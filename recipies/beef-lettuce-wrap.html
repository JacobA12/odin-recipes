        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Rinse whole lettuce leaves and pat dry, being careful not to tear them; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                Drain and discard grease; transfer beef to a bowl. 
                Add onion to the same skillet; cook and stir until just tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in hoisin sauce, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, and chile pepper sauce until well combined. 
                Add water chestnuts, green onions, sesame oil, and cooked beef; cook and stir until the onions just begin to wilt, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Arrange lettuce leaves around the outer edge of a large serving platter; spoon beef mixture in the center.
            </li>
        </ol>
